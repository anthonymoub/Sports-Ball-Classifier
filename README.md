# Sports Ball Classifier
*Abstract*: The objective of this project was to gain an introduction to computer vision and deep learning by building a model that predicts the sport based on an image of a ball. The project utilized deep learning techniques to analyze the images and accurately identify the sport represented by the ball in the image.

The project's methodology involved the collection and preprocessing of image data, the development and training of a deep learning model using convolutional neural networks, and the evaluation of the model's performance.
